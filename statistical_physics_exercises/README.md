# Statistical Physics Exercises

This project collects numerical explorations of statistical physics concepts,
with an emphasis on interactive experimentation and reproducible workflows.

## Getting Started

1. Create and activate a virtual environment (Python 3.10+ recommended).
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Explore the examples in `src/` or launch notebooks from `notebooks/`.

## Repository Layout

- `src/` — Python modules for simulations and helper utilities.
- `notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks for exploratory work.
- `data/` — Input data files (raw and processed). Keep large files out of the repo.
- `tests/` — Unit tests to guard core functionality.

## Next Steps

- Implement foundational models (e.g., 2D Ising, ideal gas Monte Carlo).
- Add reproducible experiments in notebooks with clear parameter sweeps.
- Track experiment results in `outputs/` or `reports/` if needed.
